# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc
This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
I have also used Streamlit to build an interactive web-based frontend for this project, allowing users to input data and receive real-time predictions through a simple and intuitive interface.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)

Accuracy achieved: 90.16% (Random Forest)

üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit as Frontend :

    1. Used Streamlit to build a clean and interactive web-based frontend.
    2. Enables users to enter patient data through a simple UI.
    3. Automatically handles form inputs and displays predictions in real-time.
    4. Eliminates the need for traditional web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    5. Very easy to set up and run locally with a single command (streamlit run).
    6. Great for quickly prototyping and deploying machine learning apps.
    7. Lightweight, responsive, and ideal for data-driven applications.
